  Hello, fair artist, your artwork has caught my gallant eye! By the Round Table, it's as resplendent as Camelot itself, and as full of vigor as a quest for the Holy Grail.

  Your mastery of color is as keen as my lance, and the emotions within each piece resonate as mightily as a knightly charge into battle. Verily, the way you paint, with courage and valor, it is as if you wield Excalibur itself.

  Ever in admiration,
  Sir Lancelot the Brave
