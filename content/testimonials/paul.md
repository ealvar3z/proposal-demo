blurb: |
  Ah, señorita, your artwork has caught the eye of El Guapo! It takes much to impress a man of my stature, but your artwork, they dance with color and life, like a fiesta in my very soul. It reminds me of the desert sun dipping behind the mountains of Santa Poco. May your work stay as wild and untamed as El Guapo's mustache, and your creativity be ever as adventurous as the life of the Infamous El Guapo!

  ¡Hasta luego, artista magnífica!
